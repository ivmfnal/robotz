        Creates read-write lock. Read-write lock has 2 ways to ackquire it: *exclusive* and *shared*.
        If the read-write lock is already acquired in a shared way, it can be acquired by any number of threads in shared way
        without blocking, but an attempt to lock it exclusively will block until the lock is completely released.
        If the lock is acquired in exclusive way, any other attempt to lock it, in exclusive or shared way will block.
        
        The lock is reentrant in the sense that if a thread acquires it in exclusive mode, it can ackquire it again in exclusive mode.
        If the lock is scquired multiple times by a thread, it has to be released the same number of times.
        
        If the lock is acquired in the shared mode by only one thread, and the same thread is trying to acquire it in exclusive mode,
        the thread will not block, and the thread will be granted exclusive lock. When the thread later releases the exclusive lock,
        the lock still remains locked by the thread in shared mode until explicitly released.
